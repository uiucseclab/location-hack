This api allows us to get all photos, including its detailed information, 
of a specific user. As long as the attacker learns the user_id of the victim, 
it can easily execute the attack to learn the vicim's locations. 
Further, the URL has a parameter 'page' to determine which page of 
photos it will retrieve. To obtain all photos, one can increase this 
parameter until no results are returned. The 'flickr_result.json' contains 
the returned results using the following URL

https://api.flickr.com/services/rest/?user_id=48247111@N07&format=json&nojsoncallback=1&extras=original_format,tags,description,geo,date_upload,owner_name&page=1&method=flickr.photos.search&format=json&nojsoncallback=1&api_key=686a04cc684a9b86ac053496b73c01c0
