The hack is based on the tool 'tinderbot'

With tinderbot, we can get the full information the tinder user, such as its name, locations and photos

We can get the all recommended users of a given user. The returned information 
includes the geo locations of each user. In our report, we introduce an 
attack strategy to disclose one victim's locations. 

NOTE: Bundle is reqired for running the ruby code. We have provide the gem files. 
Once you have bundle installed, run 'bundle install' to install all required 
module in the gem files. After that, run 'bundle exec ruby bot.py' to execute 
the code. Also, the Facebook creditial may be outdated. If so, you will need to 
provide a valid Facebook creditial that has been used for Tinder login.
